## Assignment 5 - Operator Overload

This program implement three class `FracN` (fraction numbers), `CplxN` (complex numbers), and `Mod7N` (modulo 7 numbers). They all share the overloaded operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and the stream operators `>>`, `<<`. They all have a conversion (cast) operator `int()`.
