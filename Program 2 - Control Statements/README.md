## Assignment 2 - Control Statements

This assignment implements a class `Bucket` with 3 attributes `volume`, `water`, and `color`, a constructor for the class, a member function `paint` to set the attribute `color`, a `show` to describe the object by its attributes.

An instance of `Bucket` is able to fill up with water and/or pour out water, with the `if`-`else` control statements to validate the parameter and behave accordingly;

it is also able to be fully replenished or thoroughly emptied, using `for`-loops.

The class has a method `manip` to manipulate the object in an interactive way.

In `manip`, `switch` control statement is used to determine action by user input, in a `while`-loop with a `continue`.
